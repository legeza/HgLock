Before make chandegs in a shared file set the lock on it. 
(Basic rule!)

# hglock /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

If anyone else would like to modify the same file and try to set the
lock, it will get an notification message that file are used by you
at the moment.

# hglock /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
File already locked by "root" at 15:12 15.04.2011 .

When all modification were done, release the file.

# hglock -u /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
